If I were to create my own art portfolio, I want to input a java script where you can open a picture with refreshing to a new page. I think I can make this program once I learn more about the computer language.

I think this is an excellent idea. I like how you can use this website to solve problems, such as math and history. I don’t think I will be able to create this kind of website with my skill.

This website uses java script to help user organize their notes and tasks. I feel that this is more of an app than an actual website, since I have a similar app of my smart phone.

It’s a basic java script, but I think I can do more with this. I like this because this is an example which you can be creative with this script once you learned how to type it.

When I visited this website, I was confused on how it worked. But I realized that it’s the same concept as scrolling down a shopping catalog. I thought this was very creative and innovative. It felt like an interactive commercial.
